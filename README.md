## Why I Want to Attend the Programme

I am eager to join the **Software Foundation** programme to become the best developer I can be. This programme offers a comprehensive curriculum that aligns perfectly with my career goals:

- **Software Development:** I have a solid base in full-stack development, having worked with Git, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and frameworks like Laravel, Tailwind, and Bootstrap. The opportunity to deepen my knowledge in these areas excites me.
- **DevOps Engineering:** I'm looking forward to gaining hands-on experience with Amazon Web Services, which is a critical skill for modern developers.
- **AI Engineering:** Learning about the OpenAI API is particularly intriguing as AI continues to transform the tech landscape.
- **Portfolio Building:** With the new skills acquired through this programme, I am confident that I will be able to dramatically improve my existing [portfolio](https://luistoro.co.uk)., which is essential for transitioning from learning to landing my first developer role.

### My Journey So Far

While working in retail, I invested my free time in courses on full-stack development. Unfortunately, I had to leave my retail job to return to my home country to say goodbye to a loved one. This period of transition made it difficult to find a new job, leading me to apply for Job Seeker Allowance.

During this time, I discovered the Software Foundation programme on a government website. It immediately caught my interest as it aligns perfectly with my career switch from retail to software development. I am confident that this programme will equip me with the skills and support I need to secure a job in development.
